🎤 YOUR 30-SECOND PITCH
=====================================

"Vibe Check helps people decode ambiguous text 
messages. I built it because digital communication 
lacks tone and context, causing misinterpretation 
and anxiety. 

The key UX challenge was avoiding 'AI mind-reading'—
so I designed it to show multiple possibilities, not 
certainties, and put users in control with a tone 
slider. 

I tested it with 8 users and found it reduced 
reply-drafting time by 50% while increasing 
confidence. The project demonstrates responsible 
AI design, user-centered iteration, and polished 
execution."
